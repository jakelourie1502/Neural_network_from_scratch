###### OVERVIEW: In this repo, I build a dense neural network from scratch, using NumPy and run classification on MNIST data.

The final version can be found in the Softmax_mnist file.

It achieves a 97% classification on the dataset, which is comparable to a dense-only neural network in Tensorflow, which I compare to in the notebook.

Finally, I attempt adding in handmade convolutions (edge detection) in an attempt to make the model rotation-invariant, however this does not increase classification performance.
